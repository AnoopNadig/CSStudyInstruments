# Weekly Update

Please follow this format for tracking your progress on any bugs you work
on during the week.

Each bug is associated with a single markdown file with a descriptive name.
Every week you will create another entry in every bugs file discussing the
progress you made during the week.  You should place each bug in one of the
"bug fix stages" described below.  Please also discuss any difficulties you
encounter in fixing the bug or with CrashSimulator itself.  Take a look at
example\_python\_shutil\_race.md for an example.


## Details We are Looking For

Please be detailed in your updates but do not be overly verbose.  Include
any _technical_ detail that you think would be helpful in understanding
your updates.  This can be documentation links or excerpts, code snippets,
error logs or output etc.

If you had trouble with CrashSimulator or any associated tooling detail
what happened and consider opening an issue on GitHub if appropriate.

If you abandoned a bug, please give technical details why you decided to do
so.

## Important

Please do not include personal details in these updates as they are
*visible to the entire world!*  If a personal event or circumstance
prevented progress on a bug simply state you were unable to work on the bug
during the time the update in question covered.
