# Weekly Update

Please follow this format for tracking your progress on any bugs you work on
during the week.

Each bug is associated with a single markdown file with a descriptive name.
Every week you will create another entry in every bugs file discussing the
progress you made during the week.  You should place each bug in one of the "bug
fix stages" described below.  Please also discuss any difficulties you encounter
in fixing the bug or with CrashSimulator itself.  Take a look at
example\_python\_shutil\_race.md for an example.

abandon on a bug discuss why you chose to do so.
