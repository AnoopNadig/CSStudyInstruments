Bug Identified:

_You have found a bug using one of the tools_

Source of Bug Diagnosed:

_You have examined the bug and determined its cause_

Bug Fix Implemented:

_You have implemented a working fix for the bug_

Bug Fix Submitted to Project:

_You have submitted the bug to the relevant project using the rules described in
their developer documentation_

Communication with Project in Progress:

_Your bug report and fix submission have been acknowledge by the project and
they are working to merge it or have requested you modify your submission in
some way_

Bug Fix Accepted or Merged:

_Your fix has been merged into the project or accepted for a future release_

Are there any bugs where you are stuck?  If so, why?

Are there any bugs you have given up on? If so, why?

Have you encountered any tool related problems?
