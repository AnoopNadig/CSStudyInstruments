   integration tests, etc.) for a software project? If so, discuss.

2. Do you have any experience in designing and implementing automated test
   suites (i.e. unit test suites, integration test suites).

3. Do you have any experience testing software projects using automated testing
   tools (fuzzers, static analyzers, etc.)?  If so, which tools have you used
   and how much experience do you have with them?

4. Have you used version control software?  If so, which ones?

5. What is your level of familiarity with CI/CD (continuious integration/continuous
   deployment) procedures and tools?


III. Operating Systems Concepts
1. Do you have any experience with debuggers or debugging tools?  If so, which
   ones and how much?

2. What is your familiarity with Linux applications and how they interact with
   the operating system?

3. What is your familiarity with the Linux C runtime?

4. How strong is your understanding of system calls as they are implemented
   under Linux?

5. How much experience do you have with networking and socket programming under
   linux?

6. Have you used any virtualization or container technologies?  If so, which
   ones?  How much experience do you have with them?


IV. Developer Demographics
1. What academic program are you attending?

2. What previous education

3. Do you have any professional work experience? If so, discuss.


V. Open Source Participation
1. Have you contributed code/patches to any open source projects? If so, which
   ones and to what extent?

2. Have you submitted bug reports to any open source projects?  If so, which
   ones?

3. Do you participate in any open source social development sites (e.g. GitHub,
   BitBucket, etc.)  If so, which ones? You do not need to provide your account
   names for these sites.


VI. Likert Questions (These might need to be rolled into the above sections)

1. On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being lowest and 5 being the highest, rate your
   overall skill level at writing code in your most proficient language.

2. On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest, rate
   your overall degree of experience in the above software engineering concerns
   (i.e. automated testing, source code management etc.).
   *Preston -> Might want to split this into more granular questions*

3. On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the loest and 5 being the highest, rate
   your overall degree of experience in operating system concepts (i.e. system
   calls, application runtimes, etc.).


## Post Survey?

I. Opinions about the tools

1. With what tool were you **most** successful in finding bugs?

2. With what tool were you the **least** successful in finding bugs?

3. Which tool did you **most** perfer working with?

4. Which tool did you **least** prefer working with?

For the following questions, choose which tool you feel is the best fit for the
given scenario.  If no tool is appropriate, state as much. If possible, please
describe your reasoning.

1. You must choose a tool to use for your own personal work in finding bugs in
   open source projects.

2. You must choose a tool to integrate into into the testing procedures for a
   large software project.

3. You must choose a tool to assist a novice developer in debugging their class
   projects.


# Interview Questionnaire

*Preston-> I need to think about what we would ask here*



# Brief Weekly Update

List the bugs you worked on this week. Use a project specific identifier or make
something up (e.g. bpo-200000, yet-unnamed-git-bug, or similar).



Place each of the above bugs into one of the following stages:

Bug Identified:

_You have found a bug using one of the tools_

Source of Bug Diagnosed:

_You have examined the bug and determined its cause_

Bug Fix Implemented:

_You have implemented a working fix for the bug_

Bug Fix Submitted to Project:

_You have submitted the bug to the relevant project using the rules described in
their developer documentation_

Communication with Project in Progress:

_Your bug report and fix submission have been acknowledge by the project and
they are working to merge it or have requested you modify your submission in
some way_

Bug Fix Accepted or Merged:

_Your fix has been merged into the project or accepted for a future release_

Are there any bugs where you are stuck?  If so, why?

Are there any bugs you have given up on? If so, why?

Have you encountered any tool related problems?
